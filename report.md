# Why binary tres are used?
    Searching becomes easy and faster with the help of a binary search tree, even for huge data sets.
    Trees do not have a limit on the nodes. So, according to the user's need, a tree of any size can be created and further increased ,unlike an array                                  
    It can store hierarchical data in the database.
    A binary tree can also be used for classification and decision-making.
